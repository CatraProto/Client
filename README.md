# What is CatraProto?
CatraProto is a fully-asynchronous library that implements the MTProto protocol and the Telegram API.\
This means you can interact with the Telegram API (**as a regular user** as well) **without having any knowledge of the encryption and communication protocol**. 
It also implements many aspects of the API so **you won't have to take care of any database implementation or updates handling.**
